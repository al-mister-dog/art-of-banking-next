BANK FUNCTIONS
Overdraft limit should be set by bank

bankSettings: {
    0: {
        overdraft: true,
        interestRate: true,
        rates: {
            overdraftFee: 0,
            overdraftLimit: 0,
            interestRate: 0,
        }
    }
},
this determines whether settings are available in a given lecture



reserveRequirement: true, (set by central bank?)

action: {
    bank: {
        "Set Overdraft Fee",
        "Set Overdraft Limit",
    },
    centralBank: {
        "Set Overdraft Fee",
        "set fed funds target",
    }
}




Sequence:
Bank sets an overdraft limit.
Any customer of that bank will have this overdraft limit applied to them.

by default rates are set to zero
